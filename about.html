            <h2>What is NASA TLX?</h2>
            <p>The NASA Task Load Index (TLX) is a widely-used, multidimensional rating procedure that provides an overall workload score based on a weighted average of ratings on six subscales:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mental Demand:</strong> How much mental and perceptual activity was required?</li>
                <li><strong>Physical Demand:</strong> How much physical activity was required?</li>
                <li><strong>Temporal Demand:</strong> How much time pressure did you feel?</li>
                <li><strong>Performance:</strong> How successful were you in accomplishing the task?</li>
                <li><strong>Effort:</strong> How hard did you have to work to accomplish your level of performance?</li>
                <li><strong>Frustration:</strong> How insecure, discouraged, irritated, stressed, and annoyed were you?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>History and Development</h3>
            <p>The NASA TLX was developed by Sandra G. Hart and Lowell E. Staveland at NASA Ames Research Center in the 1980s. It was created to provide a reliable and valid measure of workload that could be applied across various domains and tasks.</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Task Selection:</strong> Choose the task or set of tasks you want to evaluate.</li>
                <li><strong>Rating Scale:</strong> Ask participants to rate the task on the six subscales.</li>
                <li><strong>Weighting Procedure:</strong> Determine the importance of each subscale for the specific task.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Calculate the overall workload score using the weighted ratings.</li>
            </ol>
